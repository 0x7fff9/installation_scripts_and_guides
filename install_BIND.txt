# If building a live DNS server
# Above the existing options block, create a new ACL block called "trusted". This is where we will define list of clients that we will allow recursive DNS queries from (i.e. your servers that are in the same datacenter as ns1). Using our example private IP addresses, we will add ns1, ns2, host1, and host2 to our list of trusted clients:

vim /etc/bind/named.conf.options

Add (with the server IP's changed)

acl "trusted" {
        192.168.1.11;    # ns1 - can be set to localhost
        192.168.1.12;    # ns2
        192.168.100.101;  # host1
        192.168.100.102;  # host2
};
